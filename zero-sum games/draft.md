# The Idea

set up a game from the book (odd, even)
let Player I one choose the probability for his mixed strategy

develop different Player II strategies:
- pure strategy (only ones)
- pure strategy (only twos)
- mixed strategy with different probs
- reactive strategies (veritasium video)
    - counter last move
    - copy last move
    - every other move
    - change on loss
    - change on win
    - change on win, but randomly
    - change after two wins
